# 75HardChallenge

Welcome to the 75HardChallenge project! This is a web application created using Vite, React and Tailwind CSS, designed to help participants take on the 75Hard Challenge.

## Overview

The 75Hard Challenge is a personal development journey that lasts for 75 consecutive days. Participants set specific goals for themselves, work towards them, and track their progress daily. However, it comes with strict rules to ensure commitment and consistency.

## Live Site

To access the live site and start your 75Hard Challenge journey, visit [75HardChallenge](http://75hardchallenge.netlify.app).

## Rules

### Duration

- The Challenge will last for a period of 75 consecutive days.

### Goal Submission

- Participants must submit their set of goals for the entire 75-day period at the start of the Challenge.
- Once goals are submitted, they cannot be changed during the Challenge.

### Progress Tracking

- Participants are required to log in to the Challenge website daily to mark their progress for the day as completed.
- Progress can be tracked using a visual progress bar.

### Challenge Interruption

- If a participant fails to mark a day as completed within the 24-hour timeframe, the Challenge for that day is considered skipped.
- Skipping a day during the 75-day period will result in the participant's Challenge being halted.
- In the event of a skipped day, all goals will be reset, and the participant must start the Challenge from the beginning.

### Timer and Goal Completion

- Participants have a 24-hour window each day to mark their daily goal as completed.
